# unity-like-plank-theme
A plank dock theme that doesn't look like Unity but gives you a similar interface:

**After installing my theme just go to plank's preferences and set:**
  - Position: left
  - Alignment: panel-mode
  - ItemsAlignment: left

Cinnamon users
-----------
If you are using cinnamon (like me :), you can install Window Buttons with Title applet (http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/184) and Cinnamon Maximus extension (http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/29) to make your interface more like Unity.

Installation
-----------
Just copy *Unity-like* directory to */usr/share/plank/themes/* or to *~/.local/share/plank/themes/*. After that you can choose it via plank's settings.

**Arch linux users** can simply install my package from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unity-like-plank-theme/.
